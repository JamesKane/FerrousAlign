//! Stage 3: Smith-Waterman extension
//!
//! Extends seed chains into full alignments using banded Smith-Waterman.
//! This is the most compute-intensive stage and benefits heavily from SIMD.
//!
//! # Submodules (to be created in Phase 4)
//!
//! - `region.rs` - Region extension logic
//! - `batch.rs` - Batch orchestration for SIMD

// Implementation will be added in Phase 4
