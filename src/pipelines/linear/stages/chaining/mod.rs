//! Stage 2: Seed chaining
//!
//! Groups compatible seeds into chains using O(n²) dynamic programming.
//! Chains represent candidate alignment regions for extension.
//!
//! # Submodules (to be created in Phase 4)
//!
//! - `dp_chain.rs` - Core DP chaining algorithm
//! - `filter.rs` - Chain filtering and selection

// Implementation will be added in Phase 4
