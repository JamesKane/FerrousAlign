//! Stage 1: SMEM extraction (Seeding)
//!
//! Generates Super-Maximal Exact Matches (SMEMs) from read sequences using
//! FM-Index backward search. This is the first computational stage after loading.
//!
//! # Submodules (to be created in Phase 2)
//!
//! - `smem.rs` - Core SMEM algorithm
//! - `reseeding.rs` - Chimeric detection and re-seeding
//! - `forward_only.rs` - 3rd round seeding strategy
//! - `seed_convert.rs` - SMEM to Seed conversion

// Implementation will be added in Phase 2
