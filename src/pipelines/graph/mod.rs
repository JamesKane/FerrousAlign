//! Pangenome graph alignment pipeline (future implementation).
//!
//! This module will contain the graph-based alignment workflow including:
//! - Graph index structures (GFA-based)
//! - Graph-aware seeding (minimizers/strobemers)
//! - Graph-aware chaining (DAG colinear chaining)
//! - Path traversal and coordinate systems
//!
//! Currently a placeholder for future development.
